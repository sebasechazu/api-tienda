#  API for MongoDB Integration using JavaScript and Node.js

This project is a RESTful API built with JavaScript and Node.js, designed to interact seamlessly with a MongoDB database. The API provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources in MongoDB, leveraging the flexibility and scalability of the database. It's built with a focus on modularity and efficiency, ensuring that database operations are performed optimally.

Key features include:

* Node.js and Express for handling server-side logic and routing.
* MongoDB as the database for managing and storing data.
* Error handling and logging using industry best practices.


This API is suitable for applications that require robust data management, and it can serve as a foundation for more complex systems that need to integrate with MongoDB.
